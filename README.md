# 🎬 Movie Data Analysis Project (1980–2020)

Welcome to a Python-based data analysis project where we explore 30,000 movies released between 1980 and 2020.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to:
- Load and clean real-world movie data
- Explore genres, directors, ratings, and durations
- Visualize rating distributions, top genres, and more
- Create new features like `Movie Age` and `Director Popularity`

## 📂 Dataset Features

- **Title**
- **Director**
- **Genre**
- **Release Date**
- **Duration** (in minutes)
- **Rating**

## 🚀 Key Analysis Performed

✅ Distribution of ratings  
✅ Most common genres  
✅ Most frequent directors  
✅ Relation between duration and rating  
✅ Genre-wise average ratings  
✅ Outlier detection (very short/long movies)  
✅ Feature Engineering:
- `Movie Age` = 2020 - Release Year
- `Director Popularity` = Average rating per director
